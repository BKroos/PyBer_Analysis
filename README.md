# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to look at data from a ride-share company, PyBer. This data included two different csv files, one which focused on data within rides, and one which focused on city-specific data. The analysis sought to understand the total footprint of the app in both number of rides within cities and number of drivers, as well as analyzing how these two factors influenced ride price and revenue. 

## Results
The clearest finding from this analysis reveals a major separation within the city "Type" between "Urban" cities and "Rural" cities. Presumably, the separation in these types is due to population metrics, however, this information was not made clear to me. Overall, Urban cities had more rides, more drivers, and generated the most revenue. Not surprisingly, these metrics flip when examined on a per-ride or per-driver basis. In these measures, it is instead the Rural cities which generate more on a per capita or average basis. Suburban cities lie between for all of the above analysis. 

## Summary
These results are not surprising, given how ride-hailing apps operate and make money. My recommendation would be to continue expanding in additional Urban cities, as these generated nearly twice the revenue of Suburban, and nearly 10 times the revenue of Rural cities. For the Rural cities, the margin is much finer, so I would recommend we be careful in determining where to expand into Rural communities. For Suburban cities, I think caution is warranted. A very rudimentary rule of thumb could be for every 10 Urban cities, we add 5 Suburban and 1 Rural city, to ensure we're balancing our footprint and seeking to maximize revenue.
